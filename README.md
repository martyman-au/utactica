UTACTICA game in development for Udacity HTML5 course

Utatica is a turn based, two player, resource gathering, strategy game. It was created for the Udacity CS255 game creation contest.

I started by developing the game concept as a board game and once I had come up with a concept that worked and was fun and playable I started converting it into a html5 based computer game.
