UTACTICA game in development for Udacity HTML5 course

Utatica is a turn based, two player, resource gathering, strategy game.

I started by developing the game concept as a printed out board game. Once I had come up with a concept that worked as a game and was fun to play I started converting it into a html5 based computer game.
